On this example, we should distinguis the flags that are set on the operations.

xor eax, eax
jz short loc_40100B	; The flas Z is set.

CF - Carry Flag
PF - Parity Flag
AF - Adjust Flag
ZF - Zero Flag
SF - Sign Flag
OF - Overflow Flag

Test, Computes the bit-wise logical AND of first operand (source 1 operand) and the second operand (source 2 operand) and sets the SF, ZF, and PF status flags according to the result. The result is then discarded.

loc_40100B:
  mov ecx, 1
  test ecx, ecx
  jz short loc_401016	; Z not set.


int main(){


}
